Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is a piece of C++ code that shows some very peculiar behavior. For some strange reason, sorting the data miraculously makes the code almost six times faster:</p>
<pre class="lang-cpp prettyprint-override"><code>#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
	// Generate data
	const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
	int data[arraySize];

	for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
		data[c] = std::rand() % 256;


	// !!! With this, the next loop runs faster.
	std::sort(data, data + arraySize);


	// Test
	clock_t start = clock();
	long long sum = 0;

	for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
	{
		// Primary loop
		for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
		{
			if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
				sum += data[c];
		}
	}

	double elapsedTime = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

	std::cout &lt;&lt; elapsedTime &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	std::cout &lt;&lt; "sum = " &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Without <code>std::sort(data, data + arraySize);</code>, the code runs in 11.54 seconds.</li>
<li>With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>Initially I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly, so I tried Java:</p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;

public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		// Generate data
		int arraySize = 32768;
		int data[] = new int[arraySize];

		Random rnd = new Random(0);
		for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
			data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;


		// !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
		Arrays.sort(data);


		// Test
		long start = System.nanoTime();
		long sum = 0;

		for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
		{
			// Primary loop
			for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
			{
				if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
					sum += data[c];
			}
		}

		System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);
		System.out.println("sum = " + sum);
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>with a similar but less extreme result.</p>
<hr/>
<p>My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but then I thought how silly that was because the array was just generated.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is going on?</li>
<li>Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array? The code is summing up some independent terms, so the order should not matter.</li>
</ul>

Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?

You are a victim of branch prediction fail.

What is Branch Prediction?
Consider a railroad junction:

Now for the sake of argument, suppose this is back in the 1800s - before long distance or radio communication.
You are the operator of a junction and you hear a train coming. You have no idea which way it is supposed to go. You stop the train to ask the driver which direction they want. And then you set the switch appropriately.
Trains are heavy and have a lot of inertia. So they take forever to start up and slow down.
Is there a better way? You guess which direction the train will go!

If you guessed right, it continues on.
If you guessed wrong, the captain will stop, back up, and yell at you to flip the switch. Then it can restart down the other path.

If you guess right every time, the train will never have to stop.
If you guess wrong too often, the train will spend a lot of time stopping, backing up, and restarting.

Consider an if-statement: At the processor level, it is a branch instruction:

You are a processor and you see a branch. You have no idea which way it will go. What do you do? You halt execution and wait until the previous instructions are complete. Then you continue down the correct path.
Modern processors are complicated and have long pipelines. So they take forever to "warm up" and "slow down".
Is there a better way? You guess which direction the branch will go!

If you guessed right, you continue executing.
If you guessed wrong, you need to flush the pipeline and roll back to the branch. Then you can restart down the other path.
